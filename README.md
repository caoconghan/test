# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### 1. Installation
You need install **nltk**, **sklearn**  libraries. Besides, no need to install additional libraries other than Python integrated in Anaconada.The code should run using Python 3.* .
  
### 2. Project Motivation
In this project I analyze disaster data from [Fieure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) to build a machine model to classify disaster messages using Python scripts:
1. Write a data cleaning pipeline. 
2. Write a machine learning pipeline.
3. Add two exrta features in the Flask Web App provided by Udacity.

### 3.File Descriptions
There are 3 Python scrips that have be witten or changed, Also, these scrips output a databse and a pickle file.
1. `data/process_data.py `  
* Load the `disaster_messages.csv` and `disaster_categories.csv`. Second, 
* Merget the two datasets. 
* Clean the data.
* Store it in a SQLite databse, for example `DisasterResonse.db`   
2. ` models/train_classifier.py `
* Load the data from the SQLite database built by `data/process_data.py`, for example `DisasterResonse.db` .
* Splits the dataset into training and test sets. 
* Build a machine pipeline of ` CountVectorizer`, `TfidfTransformer` and `MultiOutputClassifier(RandomForestClassifier)`.
* Use the `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters
* Output result on the test set using f1 score, precision and recall.
* Export the final model as a pickle file.
3. `app/run.py`
   In this Python script, I add two extra visuals showing in thr Flask web app.
### 4. Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
